# Markdown Rendering & Title Display - FIX 🔧

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Markdown Not Rendering
**Problem**: Headers like `#### Introduction` were showing as raw text with # symbols

**Solution**: Added support for 4-level headers (####)

**Before**:
```
#### Introduction: What is the problem and motivation?
```
Displayed as plain text with #### visible

**After**:
```
Introduction: What is the problem and motivation?
```
Displayed as bold, properly sized header

### ✅ Issue 2: Title Not Showing
**Problem**: Paper title wasn't being extracted or displayed

**Solution**: Enhanced title extraction with multiple fallback strategies

**New Logic**:
1. First, looks for `TITLE: [title]` format
2. If not found, extracts the first substantial line (20-200 chars)
3. Skips lines starting with # or common headers
4. Displays in gradient box at top

---

## Technical Changes

### 1. Enhanced Header Support
Now supports all 4 markdown header levels:

```javascript
# Header 1    → 2xl, bold, gradient (largest)
## Header 2   → xl, bold, dark gray
### Header 3  → lg, bold, dark gray
#### Header 4 → base, bold, dark gray (NEW!)
```

### 2. Improved Title Extraction
```javascript
extractTitle() now:
- Checks for TITLE: format first
- Falls back to first substantial line
- Filters out common headers
- Validates length (20-200 chars)
```

### 3. Smart Title Removal
```javascript
removeTitleFromSummary() now:
- Removes TITLE: line if exists
- Also removes the extracted title line
- Prevents duplication in summary
```

## Header Rendering Levels

| Markdown | Size | Weight | Color | Usage |
|----------|------|--------|-------|-------|
| `#` | 2xl | Bold | Gradient | Main sections |
| `##` | xl | Bold | Gray-900 | Sub-sections |
| `###` | lg | Bold | Gray-900 | Sub-sub-sections |
| `####` | base | Bold | Gray-900 | Minor sections |

---

## Title Extraction Priority

1. **Explicit format**: `TITLE: Paper Title Here`
2. **First line fallback**: First line > 20 chars, < 200 chars
3. **Smart filtering**: Skips #, "Comprehensive", "Section-wise"
4. **Validation**: Must be substantial but not too long

---

## Result

✅ All markdown headers now render properly
✅ Title is extracted and displayed prominently
✅ Clean, professional formatting throughout
✅ No raw # symbols visible
✅ Proper visual hierarchy

---
